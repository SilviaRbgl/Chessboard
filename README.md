# Darstellung der möglichen Züge eines Springers

For the "DB Sprintstarter:in Junior-Entwickler:in", I built a chessboard web app using React.
The app can show the possible moves of the knight.

If you open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you will view the web app. Here you have to click in any square of the chessboard to get the possible movements of the knight.

I have also build a URL Query Parameter, so it will show you directly a possible movement. If you open [http://localhost:3000/?start=55](http://localhost:3000/?start=55) it will show you already the movements of the square with the row 5 and the column 5.

In addition, I have also build a dynamic URL, so it will show you directly a possible movement. If you open [http://localhost:3000/55](http://localhost:3000/55) it will show you already the movements of the square with the row 5 and the column 5.

## Setup

You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.

- Unzip the folder and open it in your editor.

- Open the terminal and install npm packages.
  `npm install`

- Start the server.
  `npm start`

- Run the app in the development mode.
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
